Defines what kind of layout components the subcomponents of a combined component are wrapped in. Accepts the following values: `grid`<!-- -->, `gridItems`<!-- -->, `grid2`<!-- -->, `grid2Items`<!-- -->, `stack`<!-- -->, and `group`<!-- -->. Option `grid` wraps the components into MUI Grid item components and creates a Grid container around them. Option `gridItems` just wraps the components into Grid items and leaves the container out. Options `grid2` and `grid2Items` do the same with MUI Grid2 components. Option `stack` wraps the components in a MUI Stack component, and with the `group` option the components are wrapped in a MUI FormGroup component.
