Parameters:

`element` - the phone number input DOM element,

`inputRef` - a React MutableRef object (this can be used to access the value of the component when used as an uncontrolled component), and

`defaultValue` - the default value for the phone number input when used as an uncontrolled component.

**Signature:**

```typescript
setRefs: (element: HTMLInputElement | null, inputRef?: MutableRefObject<HTMLInputElement | null>, defaultValue?: string) => void;
```
