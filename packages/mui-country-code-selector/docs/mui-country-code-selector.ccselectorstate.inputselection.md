React keeps track of the cursor position and selection of the controlled input elements. In some situations, however, React doesn't know where to place the cursor. For example, when an input does not get accepted by the onChange handler and the value is not changed, React places the cursor at the end of the value string. Only remedy to this seems to be to keep track of the cursor position internally, within the application.

**Signature:**

```typescript
inputSelection: InputSelection;
